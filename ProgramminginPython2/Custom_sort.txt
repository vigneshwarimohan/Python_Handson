Custom Sort
Description
Sort a list of integers basis the remainder they leave when divided by 5 in an ascending order, i.e. the number that leaves a lower remainder when divided by 5 should come before the number which leaves a higher remainder.

Hint: Use the appropriate ‘key’ in the sorted() function. If two integers leave the same remainder then their order — as in the original list — should be preserved.

Examples:
Input 1:
[1, 9, 35, 12, 13, 21, 10]
Output 1:
[35, 10, 1, 21, 12, 13, 9]

#Solution
import ast,sys
input_str = sys.stdin.read()
input_list = ast.literal_eval(input_str)
def func(x):
     return x % 5

a = sorted(input_list,key = func)
print(a)
