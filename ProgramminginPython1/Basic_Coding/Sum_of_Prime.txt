Sum of Primes
Description
Write python code to find the sum of prime numbers from 2 to n where n is a positive integer entered by the user.

Note: n can be non-prime or prime. You have to find sum of primes till n and not sum of n prime numbers. i.e. for input 10, output should be 17.

Hint: You can try using lambda functions and comprehensions to reduce the lines of code you have to write.



Input: A positive integer n.

Output: A integer denoting the sum of primes less than or equal to n



Sample Input:

5

Sample Output:

10

#Solution
n=int(input())#find the sum of primes from 2 to n 
l = []
if(n >1):
    for i in range(2,n+1):
        flag = 0
        for j in range(2,i):
            if(i%j == 0):
                flag =1
                break
        if(flag == 0):
            l.append(i)
else:
    exit()
    
print(sum(l))
