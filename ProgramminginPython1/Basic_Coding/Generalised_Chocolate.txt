Generalised Chocolate
Description
Earlier you solved the chocolate problem where Sanjay had m rupees and cost of each chocolate was c rupees. Shopkeeper gave away one chocolate for three wrappers. In this problem lets generalise the question saying, Sanjay has m rupees, each chocolate costs c rupees, shopkeeper will give away k chocolates for w wrappers. Can you find now how many chocolates Sanjay will be able to eat?

Input: 4 integers separated by space in order m c w k
integers c and w will be >0
integers m and k will be >=0
integer k will be <w
Output: An integer denoting number of chocolates Sanjay will be able to get.
Sample input:
15, 2, 3, 1

Sample output:
10
Explanation:
Sanjay has 15 rupees, buys 7 chocolates for 2 rupees each.
Sanjay now has 7 wrappers, exchanges 6 of them for 2 more chocolates.
Sanjay now has 3 wrappers and exchanges them for 1 more chocolate making a total of 10 chocolates

Sample input:
15, 2, 3, 2
Sample output:
17

#Solution
my_input = input()
my_list = my_input.split(",")
m=int(my_list[0])
p =int(my_list[1])
w = int(my_list[2])
k = int(my_list[3])
c = 0

if(p >0 ) and (w >0) and (m >=0) and(k>=0) and (k<w):
    No_0f_Choc = m//p
    c = c+No_0f_Choc
    Tot = c
    while(Tot//w > 0):
            wrap = Tot%w
            wrap_choc = (Tot//w) * k
            c=wrap_choc+c
            if(wrap_choc != 0):
                wrap = wrap+wrap_choc
                Tot = wrap
    print(c)
else:
    exit()
