Armstrong number
Description
Any number, say n is called an Armstrong number if it is equal to the sum of its digits, where each is raised to the power of number of digits in n.
For example:
153=1^3+5^3+3^3

Write Python code to determine whether an entered three digit number is an Armstrong number or not. 
Assume that the number entered will strictly be a three digit number.
Print "True" if it is an Armstrong number and print "False" if it is not.
Sample Input:
153
Sample Output:
True

#Solution
x = int(input())
a = [int(i) for i in str(x)]
if (len(a) == 3):
    cube = [j*j*j for j in a]
    armstrong = sum(cube)
    if (x == armstrong):
        print('True')
    else:
        print('False')
else:
    exit()
