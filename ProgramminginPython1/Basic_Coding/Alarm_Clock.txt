Alarm Clock
Description
You're trying to automate your alarm clock by writing a function for it. You're given a day of the week encoded as 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ... 6=Sat, 7=Sun, and whether you are on vacation as a boolean value (a boolean object is either True or False. Google "booleans python" to get a better understanding). Based on the day and whether you're on vacation, write a function that returns a time in form of a string indicating when the alarm clock should ring. 

When not on a vacation, on weekdays, the alarm should ring at "7:00" and on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) it should ring at "10:00". 

While on a vacation, it should ring at "10:00" on weekdays. On vacation, it should not ring on weekends, that is, it should return "off".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Input:
The input will be a list of two elements. The first element will be an integer from 1 to 7, and the second element will be a boolean value.

Output:
The output will be a string denoting the time alarm will ring or 'off'

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample input:
[7, True]

Sample output:
off

Sample input:
[3, True]

Sample output:
10:00



#Solution
import ast
input_str = input()

#ast.literal_eval() will evaluate the string and make a data structure for the same
#here the input is a list since input is in '[...]', so ast.literal_eval() will
#make a list with the same data as passed
input_list = ast.literal_eval(input_str)

#the data or the two values in list is now changed to separate variables
week_day =[1,2,3,4,5]
week_end = [6,7]
day_of_the_week = input_list[0] #first element is an integer denoting the day of the week
is_on_vacation = input_list[1] #this is a boolean denoting if its vacation or not

if(is_on_vacation):
    if(day_of_the_week in week_end):
        print("off")
    else:
        print("10:00")
elif(day_of_the_week in week_day) :
    print("7:00")
else:
    print("10:00")
