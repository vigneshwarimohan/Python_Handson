Description
A pascal's triangle is a very interesting mathematical concept.
Each number here is a sum of the two numbers directly above it.
Following is an 8 level Pascal's triangle:﻿﻿
You can read about Pascal's triangle here.
Your task is to print an nth level of Pascal's triangle.
The input will contain an integer n.
The output will contain 1 line of the list of numbers representing the nth row of Pascal's triangle.

Sample Input:
6
Sample Output:

[1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]

#Solution
def cell(n,k):
    a = factorial(n)
    
    b = factorial(k)
    
    c = factorial(n-k)
    
    fact = a/(b*c)
    return(fact)

def factorial(m):
    ans=1   
    if(m == 0):
        return(1)
    else:    
         for i in range(1,m+1):
            ans = i*ans
    return(ans)

k=0
Number = int(input())
final = []
for i in range(k,Number):
    pascal = cell(Number-1,i) 
    final.append(int(pascal))
print(final)
