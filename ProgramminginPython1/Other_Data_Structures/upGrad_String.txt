upGrad String
Description
For the purpose of this question, we will define something called an upGrad string. Note that this definition is not valid outside this question. A string upGrad string if the frequency of its characters is something like 1, 2, 3, 4, .... That is a character appears only once, another appears twice, another appears thrice and so on. For example string '$yrr$ssrsr' is a beautiful string since the frequency of y:1, $:2, s:3, r:4, however string '$yrr$ssrsr%' will not be beautiful since it has two characters (y and %) with frequency 1. The frequency of characters should be of form 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... only.
Given a string, can you determine if the string is upGrad string or no?
