Rolling the dice
A die is rolled n times. You have to find the probability that a number i is rolled at least j times(up to four decimal places)
The input will contain the integers n, i and j in three lines respectively. You can assume that j<n and 0<i<7.
The output should be rounded off to four decimal places.
Sample Input:
4
1
2
Sample Output:
0.1319

Solution

n=int(input())
i=int(input())
j=int(input())


import scipy.stats as ss
s = 0
tot = j

while(tot<=n):
    s = s+ss.binom.pmf(tot,n,0.166666667)
    tot=tot+1
print(round(s,4))
