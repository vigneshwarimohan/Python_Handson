Confidence Intervals
For a given column in a dataframe, you have to calculate the 90 percent confidence interval for its mean value. (You can find Z* value for 90 percent confidence from previous segments)
The input will have the column name. 
The output should have the confidence interval printed as a tuple.
Note: Do not use the inbuilt function via statmodels.api or any other libraries. You should write the code on your own to get accurate answers.
The confidence interval values have to be approximated up to two decimal places.
Sample Input:
GRE Score

Sample Output:
(315.87, 317.75)

Solution
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
import math
df=pd.read_csv("https://media-doselect.s3.amazonaws.com/generic/N9LKLvBAx1y14PLoBdL0yRn3/Admission_Predict.csv")
col = input()
mean_value = df[col].mean()
st_dev = df[col].describe()[2]
con_inter1 = mean_value - (1.65*st_dev)/math.sqrt(df[col].describe()[0])
con_inter2= mean_value +(1.65*st_dev)/math.sqrt(df[col].describe()[0])
a = (round(con_inter1,2),round(con_inter2,2))
#print(round(con_inter1,2),round(con_inter2,2))
#print(round(con_inter2,2))
print(a)
