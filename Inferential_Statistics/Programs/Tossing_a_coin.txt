Tossing a coin
Given that you are tossing a coin n times, you have to find the probability of getting heads at most m times.
The input will have two lines containing n and m respectively.
Sample Input:
10
2
Sample Output:
0.0547

Solution
n=int(input())#number of trials
m=int(input())# find the probability of getting at most m heads

import scipy.stats as ss
s = 0
i = 0
while(i<=m):
    s = s+ss.binom.pmf(i,n,0.5)
    i=i+1
print(round(s,4))
