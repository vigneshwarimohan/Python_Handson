Generating normal distribution
Generate an array of real numbers representing a normal distribution. You will be given the mean and standard deviation as input. You have to generate 10 such numbers.
Hint: You can use numpy's np.random here.  You can read more about it here.
To keep the output consistent, you have to set the seed as a specific number which will be given to you as input. Setting a seed means that every time you generate random numbers, they will be the same for the same seed. You can read more about it here.

Input Format:
The input will contain 3 lines which have the seed, mean and standard deviation of the distribution in the same order.
The output will be a numpy array of the generated normal distribution.

Sample Input:
1
0
0.1

Sample Output:
[ 0.16243454 -0.06117564 -0.05281718 -0.10729686  0.08654076 -0.23015387
  0.17448118 -0.07612069  0.03190391 -0.02493704]
  
Solution
import numpy as np 
seed=int(input())
mean=float(input())#mu
std_dev=float(input())#sigma
#write your code here
#seed = 100
np.random.seed(seed)
#s = #store your result here.
s = np.random.normal(mean,std_dev,10)
print(s)
