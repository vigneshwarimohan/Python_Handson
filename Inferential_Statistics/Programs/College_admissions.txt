College admissions
The probability that a college will accept a student's application is x.
Consider that m students have applied to college. You have to find the probability that at most n students are accepted by the college.
The input will contain three lines with x, m and n respectively.
The output should be rounded off to four decimal places.
Sample Input:
0.3
5
2
Sample Output:
0.8369

Solution
x=float(input())#number of applicants
m=int(input())#probability of accepting an application
n=int(input())#find the probability that at most n applications are accepted

while(i<=n):
    s = s+ss.binom.pmf(i,m,x)
    i=i+1
print(round(s,4))
