Employee Training
Description
You are provided with the dataset of a company which has offices across three cities - Mumbai, Bangalore and New Delhi. The dataset contains the rating (out of 5) of all the employees from different departments (Finance, HR, Marketing and Sales). 

The company has come up with a new policy that any individual with a rating equal to or below 3.5 needs to attend a training. Using dataframes, load the dataset and then derive the column ‘Training’ which shows ‘Yes’ for people who require training and ‘No’ for those who do not.

Print the first 5 rows as the output. Refer to the image below for your reference.

Note: You should not sort or modify values in other columns of the dataframe.
