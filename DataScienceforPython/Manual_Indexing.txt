Manual Indexing
Description
Create a panda series that contains the first ‘n’ natural numbers and their respective squares. The first ‘n’ numbers should appear in the index position.
Hint: Use manual indexing.
 
Format:
Input: A natural number 'n'
Output: A pandas series with the first 'n' natural numbers in the index position and their respective squares in the adjacent column.

Example:
Input 1:
4
Output 1:
1  1 
2  4 
3  9 
4  16 
dtype: int64

n = int(input())
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
arrays = np.array([np.arange(start=1, stop=n+1)]) # generating array of n natural numbers starting from 1
oned = arrays.reshape(-1) # Reshaping it to 1 dimensional array as we need to handle it in pd.series
b = oned ** 2 # calculating squares for each number in the array
s2 = pd.Series(b,index = range(1,n+1))#pd.series is used to generate a index for the n natural numbers and its squares
print(s2)


#Upgrad Solution
n = int(input())

import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 

# Create a pandas series having the squares of the first 'n' natural numbers using
# the range function and specify the index explicitly from 1 to n, again, using the
# range function
x = pd.Series(np.array(range(1,n+1))**2, index = range(1,n+1))

# Print the created series
print(x)
