Shift vowels to beginning
Description
Write a program that receives a string and shifts all the vowels present in it to the beginning. Output the resultant string. The order of all the vowels with respect to each other as well as the order of all the other charcaters with respect to each other should stay the same.

Example:
Input 1:
You love Python!
Output 1:
ouoeoY lv Pythn!

Explanation: All the vowels have been shifted to the beginning in order. The order of all the other characters remains the same.

#Solution
sentence = input('Enter your sentence: ' )
for letter in sentence:
    if letter in 'aeiou':
        print(letter,end = "")
for letter in sentence:
    if letter not in 'aeiou':
        print(letter,end = "")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		
#Solution 2

# Read the input string 
s = input()
# Declare two empty strings: "vowel" and "others" which will contain all the vowels
# and the other characters respectively
vowel = ""
others = ""
# Run a loop throughout the length of the string 
for i in range(len(s)):
# If the current character is a vowel, append it to the vowel string
    if s[i] in "aeiou":
        vowel = vowel + s[i]
       
# Else, append it to the others string
    else:
        others = others + s[i]

# Add the vowel and others string in order and store it in a new variable - final        
final = vowel + others

# Print the value of the final string
print(final)
