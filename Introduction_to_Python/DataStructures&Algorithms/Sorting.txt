Using the Built-in Sort Function
Description
Sort a list of strings according to their length, with the smallest string appearing first.
Hint: Use the appropriate ‘key’ in the sorted() function. If two strings are of the same length then their order — as in the original string — should be preserved.

Example:
Input 1:
[‘I’, ‘love’, ‘to’, ‘code’, ‘in’, ‘Python’]
Output 1:
[‘I’, ‘to’, ‘in’, ‘love’, ‘code’, ‘Python’]


#Solution
def Sorting(lst): 
    x = sorted(lst, key=len) 
    return x 
      
# Driver code 
input_list =  ['I', 'love', 'to', 'code', 'in', 'Python'] 
print(Sorting(input_list))
