Sets Practice
Description
Letâ€™s say you have two lists A and B. Identify the elements which are common in the two lists A and B and return them in a sorted manner. For example 

Sample Input :
A = [5, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7]
B = [3, 3, 5, 5, 1 ,7 ,2]

Sample Output:
[1,3,5,7]

If you observe the sample output here you can see that 

Though value 5 is repeated twice in both lists, in the final output it is present only once.
The values are returned in a sorted manner with values increasing.

#Solution
import ast,sys
input_str = sys.stdin.read()
input_list = ast.literal_eval(input_str)
list_1 = input_list[0]
list_2 = input_list[1]
a=set(list_1)
b=set(list_2)
c = a.intersection(b)
answer = sorted(c)
#Type your answer here
print(answer)
